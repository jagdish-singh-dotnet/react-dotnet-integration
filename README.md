# React + ASP.NET Core Integration

This repository demonstrates a simple integration between a React frontend
and an ASP.NET Core Web API.

The focus of this project is on API communication, request/response handling,
and clean separation between frontend and backend responsibilities.

## Scope
- Basic React UI
- API consumption using fetch / axios
- Simple data rendering
- No complex UI or state management

## Backend
- ASP.NET Core Web API
- RESTful endpoints
- JSON-based communication

## Notes
This project is intentionally minimal and focuses on integration patterns
rather than frontend-heavy implementation.

## Purpose
Created for learning, demonstration, and interview discussions.
Does not contain any proprietary or production code.
